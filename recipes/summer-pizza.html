    <h2>Special Pizza</h2>
    <p>This summer pizza is loaded with fresh veggies, light on the cheese, and is made on the grill. The butter glaze makes a nice finish, but you can skip it if you like.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
      <li>1/4 cup pesto</li>
      <li>1/3 cup shredded quesadilla cheese</li>
      <li>10 thin slices zucchini</li>
      <li>10 thin slices summer squash</li>
      <li>2 mini bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 thin slice red onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 strip cooked bacon, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape pizza dough into a circle.</li>
      <li>Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.</li>
      <li>Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat. Close the cover. <br/> Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Use tongs to flip pizza dough over; move to the indirect heat. Brush dough with pesto. <br/> Sprinkle with cheese. Scatter on zucchini, summer squash, bell pepper, red onion, and bacon.</li>
      <li>Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill.</li>
      <li>Optional: Brush crust edges with butter glaze and place pizza under the oven broiler, until golden.</li>
    </ol>
