    <h2>What is Tater Tot?</h2>
    <p>This amazing ground turkey casserole — topped with cheesy, crispy tater tots — is simple to make, <br/> easy on the budget, and a perfect choice for feeding large groups of hungry people.</p>
    <p>It’s also not a casserole. It’s a hot dish. And what’s the difference between a casserole and a hot dish? There isn’t any, other than the location where you’re making this.<br/> This is called a casserole everywhere except in the Upper Midwest. There, it’s a hot dish (or hot dish, depending who you ask).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups sliced brown mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground turkey</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>6 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) bag frozen tater tots</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over high heat, and cook and stir mushrooms with a big pinch of the salt until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add onions and sauté until onions turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add turkey, and cook for a few minutes, breaking meat up into smaller crumbles.</li>
      <li>Stir in the rest of the salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. <br/> Reduce heat to medium high, and cook until turkey is lightly browned and crumbly and liquid is mostly evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle over and stir in flour; cook, stirring, to cook out the raw taste of the flour, another 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in green chiles, bell pepper, and chicken broth. <br/> Wait for the mixture to simmer, and cook, stirring, until the liquids thicken, and the texture is to your liking, about 2 minutes. <br/> Mixture can be reduced to thicken further, or broth can be added for a thinner texture.</li>
      <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Transfer to a 9x12-inch, 9x13-inch, or equivalent casserole dish and smooth out the top. <br/> Top surface evenly with 4 ounces shredded cheese, and press cheese in lightly with the tip of a spatula.</li>
      <li>Cover casserole surface evenly with 1 layer of frozen or thawed tater tots <br/> (if using frozen, add a few minutes to the oven time). Reserve any remaining tots for another use. Top with remaining cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are crisp and golden, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
